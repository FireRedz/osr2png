# osr2png - rewrite
basically a better version of osr2png

## what's new in this version
* support custom resolution 
* no more osu.db bullshit, get everything online
* class based (?) so its easier to add stuff 
* async support but uses sync by default (pysimplegui didnt support async, it does but its fucking pain to make it work (probably, doesnt try))
* basically 69420 times easier to use than whatever tf the old code was
* insert more

## How does it look
basically the same - (2560, 1080)
